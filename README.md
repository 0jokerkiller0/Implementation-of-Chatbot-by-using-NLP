# Implementation of Chatbot by using NLP

## Overview
This project is an **AI-powered chatbot** that uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to understand and respond to user queries intelligently. The chatbot recognizes different intents and provides relevant responses using **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)** for text processing and **scikit-learn** for training a simple machine learning model.

## Features
- ✅ **NLP-based text processing** using NLTK  
- ✅ **Intent recognition** to classify user input  
- ✅ **Predefined responses** for different intents  
- ✅ **Machine Learning-based response prediction**  
- ✅ **Interactive console-based chatbot**  
- ✅ **Easily customizable intents and responses**  

## Technologies Used
- **Python** 🐍  
- **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)**  
- **Scikit-learn** (TF-IDF Vectorizer & Logistic Regression)  
- **NumPy & Pandas**  
- **JSON for training data**  

## How It Works
1. **Data Preparation**: The chatbot is trained on a dataset containing various **intents, patterns, and responses** (stored in `intents.json`).  
2. **Text Preprocessing**: The input text is **tokenized, stemmed, and vectorized** using **TF-IDF**.  
3. **Model Training**: A **Logistic Regression model** is trained to classify user input into different intents.  
4. **Response Generation**: Based on the classified intent, the chatbot provides a **predefined response**.  

## Installation
Clone the repository and install dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/0jokerkiller0/Implementation-of-Chatbot-by-using-NLP.git
cd Implementation-of-Chatbot-by-using-NLP
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Run the chatbot:
```bash
python chatbot.py
```
Type a message, and the chatbot will respond based on the trained model.

## Customization
You can modify `intents.json` to add new **intents, patterns, and responses** to make the chatbot more interactive.

## Future Enhancements
- 🔹 Integrate with **Speech-to-Text (STT) and Text-to-Speech (TTS)**  
- 🔹 Deploy as a **Web App using Flask or Streamlit**  
- 🔹 Train with **Deep Learning (RNN/LSTM)** for better accuracy  
- 🔹 Add **real-time API integration** (e.g., Weather API, News API)
